Uses 2 motors to show devices of the functions in the library.  This causes
a robot to do a little 'jig'.  Each movement has an equal and opposite movement
so assuming your motors are balanced the bot should end up at the same place it
started.

Development environment specifics:
Developed on Arduino 1.6.4
Developed with ROB-9457

// This is the library for the TB6612 that contains the class Motor and all the

#include "H_bridge_TB6612.hpp"
#include "config.h"

// Initializing motors.  The library will allow you to initialize as many
// motors as you have memory for.  If you are using functions like forward
// that take 2 motors as arguements you can either write new functions or
// call the function more than once.
Motor motor1 = Motor(AIN1, AIN2, PWMA, STBY, offsetA, 10);
Motor motor2 = Motor(BIN1, BIN2, PWMB, STBY, offsetB, 10);
